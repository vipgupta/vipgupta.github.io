<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a final-year graduate student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (<a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS</a>) where I am working with Profs. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/">Kannan Ramchandran</a>, <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~courtade/">Thomas Courtade</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>. 
Before coming to Berkeley, I received Bachelors (with distinction) and Masters in the department of <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/">Electrical Engineering</a> from the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur</a> in 2015 and 2016, respectively. I've also been an Undergraduate researcher in summers&rsquo;14 at Syracuse University and at EPFL in summers&rsquo;15. </p>
<p>I am also a co-organizer of the <a href="http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/Seminar/index.html">BLISS Seminar</a>, talks at which span information theory, machine learning, statistics, control, and optimization. Please send me an email if you are interested in giving a talk.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me regarding anything that interests you on this site.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research lies at the intersection of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machine Learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Computing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Statistics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information and Coding Theory</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a part of my Ph.D., I am happily working on problems that leverage ideas from statistics and information theory to speed-up distributed machine learning on inexpensive cloud-based services. My research is particularly motivated by problems with various practical applications. You can find a list of my publications <a href="pubs.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>During my Ph.D., I have spent the summer and fall of 2020 with the ML infrastructure team at Facebook as a research engineer, where the aim was to develop and implement new techniques to improve the training efficiency of deep recommender models. During the summer of 2019, I was an intern at AI Research at Apple, Cupertino, where I worked on devising algorithms for accelerating distributed training of deep neural networks.</p>
