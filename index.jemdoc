== About me
I am a final-year graduate student in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences ([https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ EECS]) where I am working with Profs. [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/ Kannan Ramchandran], [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~courtade/ Thomas Courtade] and [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/ Michael Mahoney]. 
Before coming to Berkeley, I received Bachelors (with distinction) and Masters in the department of [https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/ Electrical Engineering] from the [http://www.iitk.ac.in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur] in 2015 and 2016, respectively. I've also been an Undergraduate researcher in summers'14 at Syracuse University and at EPFL in summers'15. 

I am also a co-organizer of the [http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/Seminar/index.html BLISS Seminar], talks at which span information theory, machine learning, statistics, control, and optimization. Please send me an email if you are interested in giving a talk.

Feel free to contact me regarding anything that interests you on this site.

== Research
My research lies at the intersection of
- Machine Learning
- Cloud Computing
- Statistics
- Information and Coding Theory

As a part of my Ph.D., I am happily working on problems that leverage ideas from statistics and information theory to speed-up distributed machine learning on inexpensive cloud-based services. My research is particularly motivated by problems with various practical applications. You can find a list of my publications [pubs.html here]. 

During my Ph.D., I have spent the summer and fall of 2020 with the ML infrastructure team at Facebook as a research engineer, where the aim was to develop and implement new techniques to improve the training efficiency of deep recommender models. During the summer of 2019, I was an intern at AI Research at Apple, Cupertino, where I worked on devising algorithms for accelerating distributed training of deep neural networks.
